# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)

A clean, minimal, and fully functional **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using Python. This project recreates the classic 3×3 grid challenge for two players in a command-line interface, showcasing the fundamentals of logic building and game flow control.

---

OVERVIEW--
This project implements a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game entirely in Python. Players alternate turns to mark their chosen positions on the grid, and the program automatically checks for wins, draws, and valid moves. The code is modular, readable, and serves as a great introduction to game logic and user input handling in Python.
